Idea 1:

Electromechanical Automatic Relief System

Visual Pressure Sensor (for verification)

IC Pressure Sensor

Solenoid (for actuation)

MCU (STM32L152)

This system accepts gas from a pressurized system (air compressor, bike pump etc.) and holds pressure until ~75 psi is reached, at this point the solenoid is actuated in short burts to reduce the pressure in the chamber.  It will be built with PVC and cheap parts as a proof of concept.  A chamber can be made of arbitrary lengths of 1-2" PVC with T's and caps modified to allow sensors be placed inside the pressure chamber.

We've chose this design for it's simplicity, usefullness and scaling capablitity (it could be improved and used in industrial processes).
