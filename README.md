Idea 1:

Automatic Pressure Release Valve

Visual Pressure Sensor (for verification)

IC Pressure Sensor

Solenoid (for actuation)

MCU (STM32?)

This system accepts gas from a pressurized system (air compressor) and holds pressure until 75 psi is reached, at this point the solenoid is actuated in short burts to reduce the pressure in the chamber.  It will be built with PVC and cheap parts as a proof of concept.
