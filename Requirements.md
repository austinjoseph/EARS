# Requirements - EARS

### Must:
Be able to meassure pressure of a fluid.

Be able to control a relief valve of said fluid.

-Provide a method for releasing pressure at a specified threshold.

-Safely hold 100 psi pressure in a chamber.

-Contain at least one sensor.

-Contain at least one actuator.

-Have one or more processing modules which control actuators based on sensors.

-Have a PCB that is at least two layers.

-Use at least 25% surface mount components.


### Should: 
Vissualy indicate the pressure to operators.

Vissualy indicate the current state of the valve to operators.

### May:
May include temperature sensor for the fluid. (Future feature thats needed for TSAR.)

Transmit the state of the valve and the current pressure level to another system.

-Include variable pressure relief threshold
